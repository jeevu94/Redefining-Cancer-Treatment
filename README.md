# Personalized Medicine: Redefining Cancer Treatment

There are nine different classes a genetic mutation can be classified on.

This is not a trivial task since interpreting clinical evidence is very challenging even for human specialists. Therefore, modelling the clinical evidence (text) will be critical.

Goal: Develop algorithms to classify genetic mutations based on clinical evidence (text)and predict the effect of Genetic Variants to enable Personalized Medicine.
